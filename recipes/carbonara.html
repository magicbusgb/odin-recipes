    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hailing from the heart of Italy, <strong>Spaghetti Carbonara</strong> is a quintessential pasta dish loved for its simplicity and
        rich flavors. Originating from Rome, this dish traditionally consists of <em>spaghetti pasta coated in a velvety sauce
        made from eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and crispy pancetta or bacon</em>. The hot pasta cooks the eggs
        just enough to create a creamy texture without scrambling them. The result is a harmonious blend of salty, smoky,
        and creamy flavors that dance on the palate with each bite. Spaghetti Carbonara embodies the essence of Italian
        comfort food, offering a satisfying and indulgent dining experience.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>200g</strong> spaghetti</li>
        <li><strong>100g</strong> guanciale or bacon </li>
        <li><strong>2 large eggs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons </strong>  vegetable oil</li>
        <li><strong>50g</strong> grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>While spaghetti is cooking, fry pancetta or bacon in a skillet until crispy. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Once spaghetti is cooked, drain it, reserving some of the cooking water.</li>
        <li>Immediately toss the hot spaghetti with the pancetta/garlic mixture.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat, then quickly stir in the egg and cheese mixture, using the residual heat to cook the eggs
            without scrambling them. If the sauce seems too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with extra Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    </ol>
