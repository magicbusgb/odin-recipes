    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A celebration of simplicity and freshness, <strong>Caprese Salad is a beloved Italian dish that pays homage to the
        sun-ripened flavors of the Mediterranean</strong>. Named after the island of Capri, this salad features ripe tomatoes, creamy
        mozzarella cheese, and fragrant basil leaves, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic glaze. Each
        ingredient shines in its own right, with the juicy tomatoes providing a burst of sweetness, the velvety mozzarella
        lending a creamy texture, and the aromatic basil infusing the dish with a refreshing herbal note. The marriage of
        flavors and textures creates a harmonious balance that captures the essence of Italian cuisine. Whether enjoyed as a
        light appetizer, a side dish, or a standalone meal, Caprese Salad is a timeless classic that embodies the spirit of
        la dolce vita./p>
